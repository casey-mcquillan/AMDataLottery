This is intended to create a GIF that provides a more entertaining way to determine who wins a lottery.

Rules:
- Each round, each person receives between 0-4 points.
- Points accumulate across rounds.
- The first 2 people to reach 100 points win!
- If there is a tie where two or more people cross 100 points on the same round, then the tiebreaker will be whoever has the more points after that round.
- The seed will be set by asking all contestants for a random number 0-9. The order of their responses will determine the order of these numbers in the seed. The first nine entries will be used.
